## What is this site?
This is a new site I am building. It uses the onceUI framework. made mostly in react and some other stuff.
It is still in development and is not ready to be pushed as my main site.

## What will happen to my old site?
It will be deleted... well, eventually. for now it is being used as the main site and after this is finished,
it will be replaced with this one. Then the old site will be archived.

## Whats the diffrence between "Projects" and "Blog" on this site
Projects are my personal projects that I am working on, and the blog is where i just talk about random stuff.
